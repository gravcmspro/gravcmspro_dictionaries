[m-dictionary-item name="D_NO_VERTICAL_ALIGNMENT"]
  ## Text without vertical alignment
  This is a variation of the same component which is rendered removing the vertical alignment for wide screens. The **l-vertical-align** class has been removed from the **M_ROW_ATTRIBUTES** properties, as for the intenal div which is not required anymore.

[m-dictionary-item name="D_CELL_COLOR"]
  ## Using the main color of the theme
  By default, the cell color is defined by the **box-bg-secondary** class and it is assigned to each row of this component. When you need to use the main color of the theme, simply change it to **box-bg-primary**.

  If you need to use a color not used in the theme, for example the **red** one, simply replace that class with the color class name, so red in this case.
